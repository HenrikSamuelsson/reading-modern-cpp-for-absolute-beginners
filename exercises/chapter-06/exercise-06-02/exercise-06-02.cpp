 * @brief       Exercise 6.2 Declaration
 *
 * Solution for exercise 6.2 from the book Modern C++ for Absolute Beginners.
 *
 * Program that declares three variables inside the main function.
 *
 * Key takeaways from this exercise:
 *  - A declaration introduces a name for a variable into a certain scope
 *  - A variable can be used first after it have been declared
 *  - A declaration shall start with the type of the variable
 *  - The name of a variable shall be placed after the type in the declaration
